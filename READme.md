The data is imported and cleaned. Missing values and duplicate values are removed.
EDA is done on the data and important features are extracted.
Finally, models are fitted and tested. 
Out of logistic regression, support vector classifier, decision test, random forest and gaussian naive bayes, Support Vector Classifier performs the best with 83.41% accuracy, 70.19% precision, 58.1% recall and F1 Score = 0.6356.
